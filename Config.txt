In the Settings.py file inside of the API directory that is found inside of the root folder, 
we want to manipulate a few configurations so that things jive alright in the 
Development and Production environments.  

There are a few variables that one could change to ensure environment functionality/security.

Development
	DEBUG = True
	ADMIN_ENABLED = False	

Production
	DEBUG = False
	ADMIN_ENABLED = False	

Lastly, ensure that database_config.example is in the API directory. This houses all the 
credentials for database connections for the entire API.
